# Summary of wgm-mie-scattering
This Python package is meant to be a simple utility for computing
the scattering properties of airborne spherical particles.  This is
useful for remote sensing of clouds (and airborne particles) in the 
atmosphere. 

## Install (Not working yet)

For a system install use:
```
  $ python setup.py install
```

For developing in place:
```
  $ python setup.py develop
```

For building in the local directory:
```
  $ python setup.py build
```



## Requirements
Python with numpy, scipy, f2py, and some other common packages.  The
Anaconda python distribution is good, and will have all the necessary 
third party packages.
